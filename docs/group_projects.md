The group project is a collaborative effort between two or more people to create a game across the entire semester. Unlike a game jam, a group project is meant to be a slightly larger, more polished, and ultimately complete product which walks you through every phase of longer-scale game development and the undying power of friendship and teamwork.

This year, we plan to have people pitch their group projects ahead of the first section, from which people can decide which projects they would like to join. 

From this page, you can view the group projects underway, apply to group projects, and see current milestones for group project work.

### Project Session 1
#### About
The first project session of the semester will be dedicated to pitching and group-finding. This year, we ask that you pitch your game first to better find a group which shares your game development ethos and provide a more corporeal backbone to project work.

If you decide to pitch a game, you must be a least a little prepared to 'lead' your team, or ensure that your game is coming along as needed, unless you specifically delegate this to someone else.

#### Preparations

Ahead of Project Session 1, we ask that you have a small pitch of your game ready to present to the club. It could be a presentation, or a simple elevator pitch, however you might want to keep in mind:

- Concept
- Main Mechanic(s)
- Scope
- Theme/goal
- Needed roles

Why do we want to make your game? Why do we want to play it?
