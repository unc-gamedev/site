The group project is a collaborative effort between two or more people to create a game across the entire semester. Unlike a game jam, a group project is meant to be a slightly larger, more polished, and ultimately complete product which walks you through every phase of longer-scale game development and the undying power of friendship and teamwork.

This year, we plan to have people pitch their group projects ahead of the first section, from which people can decide which projects they would like to join. 

From this page, you can view the group projects underway, apply to group projects, and see current milestones for group project work.
