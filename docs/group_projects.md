The group project is a collaborative effort between two or more people to create a game across the entire semester. Unlike a game jam, a group project is meant to be a slightly larger, more polished, and ultimately complete product which walks you through every phase of longer-scale game development and the undying power of friendship and teamwork.

This year, we plan to have people pitch their group projects ahead of the first section, from which people can decide which projects they would like to join. 

From this page, you can view the group projects underway, apply to group projects, and see current milestones for group project work.

### Project Session 1
#### About
The first project session of the semester will be dedicated to pitching and group-finding. This year, we ask that you pitch your game first to better find a group which shares your game development ethos and provide a more corporeal backbone to project work.

If you decide to pitch a game, you must be a least a little prepared to 'lead' your team, or ensure that your game is coming along as needed, unless you specifically delegate this to someone else.

#### Preparations

Ahead of Project Session 1, we ask that you have a small pitch of your game ready to present to the club. It could be a presentation, or a simple elevator pitch, however you might want to keep in mind:

- Concept
- Main Mechanic(s)
- Scope
- Theme/goal
- Needed roles

Why do we want to make your game? Why do we want to play it?

### Project Session 2
#### About
The goal of the second project session will be to create an **MVP** for your game. MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product, and formally defines the version of your game which can collect the most amount of feedback for the least amount of effort. For the purpose of this club, however, your MVP will be more a proof of concept; a barebones display of your game's base mechanics.
#### Preparations
Ahead of Project Session 2, we ask that you prepare an MVP to the best of your ability which showcases the fundamental mechanics or loop of your game. You don't need to think about music, story, levels, etc. Simply a functioning example of your core mechanics is enough. You may want to keep in mind:

- Does my MPV need art?
- Which mehanics can I exclude for now?
- How many entities do I need for the game loop to work? Player? Enemies? Level?
- How can I organize this so that I can add more later?

Unrelated to the MVP, here are some other things you might want to get done:
- Completed game design document
- Defined project roles
- Git repository
- Schedule
